= About = 
Building on merle and ketama, this application enables memcached access from erlang.

= Prerequisites =

- ruby and rake for building
- libketama <http://www.audioscrobbler.net/development/ketama/>
- memcached servers <http://www.danga.com/memcached/>

= Builing =

Run rake a first time and make sure ERL_TOP is set at the right location.
sudo rake install will install the application where necessary.

= Example Usage =

Provide a ketama.servers file (such as the one here).

Open 3 terminals and start memcached in each one of them on a different port :
$ memcached -p 11211 -vv
$ memcached -p 11212 -vv
$ memcached -p 11213 -vv

Open another terminal, and run :
$ erl -s merle -merle file '"ketama.servers"' # use the one included here.

You should see on the memcached servers something like :
<18 new client connection

For the rest, see the README.orig file

You should see that the keys you set are distributed amongs the servers.

= Editing the ketama file =

The ketama.servers file is tracked and reloaded each time it is modified.
ketama provided consistent hashing goodness ; adding and removing memcached servers does not invalidate all the cache.

One caveat : currently the app doesn't flush newly added memcached servers, that may cause inconsistencies.
On top of that, I have not implemented the flush command for a specific server.
